u8glib library 1.17 for ARM
---------------------------

u8glib library 1.17 for ARM. Copied on Jan 2014 from https://code.google.com/p/u8glib/
See there for license and restrictions.

May have here slight adaptions for the LPC1115 but in general trying
to keep this as stock as possible. The repository here provides it as an
easy to install MCUXpresso project that works with LPC1115 out of the
box.
